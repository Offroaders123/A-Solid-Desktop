# A Solid Desktop

I think this was planned to be a project where I build one of those 'desktop in the browser' desktop environments. I wanted to try my own attempt at that, but with SolidJS. Most of the time I feel like I see people using React to build it. I think part of the interest here is that I wanted to try making hyper-responsive things which should work nicely with any scale size, and allow things to still be dynamic. So it will involve doing a lot of setup and planning for stateful components, and managing styles effectively.
